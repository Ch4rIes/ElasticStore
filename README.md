Project Highlights
Microservices: Implemented multiple microservices within the eCommerce cluster to handle different functionalities and responsibilities. Each microservice is developed using Java Spring Boot and is designed to be modular and scalable.

Messaging with Kafka: Utilized Kafka to enable seamless communication and message passing between different microservices in the cluster. This helps ensure efficient processing of events and improves overall system performance.

Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes: Leveraged Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration to deploy and manage the ElasticStore project. This approach provides scalability, easy management, and efficient resource utilization.

Test-Driven Development: Employed a test-driven development approach to ensure the reliability and functionality of the microservices. Integration and unit tests were conducted using Testcontainers, a testing library that allows the use of Docker containers in testing environments.
